# shape-it-ob3


## Description

Code for shape-it with openbabel3


## INSTALL

- Following example is the basic way to install the tool:

```
git clone https://github.com/iwatobipen/shape-it-ob3.git
cd shape-it-ob3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where you want to install> ..
make
make install
```


- If you would like to use rdkit for shape-it please set BUILD_RDKIT_SUPPORT=ON. Also set BUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON, you can call shape-it as a library:


```
cd shape-it-ob3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where you want to install> -DBUILD_RDKIT_SUPPORT=ON -DBUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON ..
make
make install
```

## Tips
- If the make command failed, you should try to set RDKIT_INCLUDE_DIR, Boost_INCLUDE_DIR option.

```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/iwatobipen/src/shape-it-ob3 -DRDKIT_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/iwatobipen/miniconda3/envs/chemoinfo/include/rdkit -DBUILD_RDKIT_SUPPORT=ON -DBUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/iwatobipen/miniconda3/envs/chemoinfo/pkgs/libboost-1.73.0-hf484d3e_11/include ..
make
make install
```

## History of shape-it and how to cite

Shape-it is a shape-only rewrite of the original Pharao code that was developed in 2008 by Silicos (Jonatan Taminau, [Gert Thijs](https://github.com/gertthijs) and [Hans De Winter](https://github.com/hansdewinter)). It is based on the alignment method described by Grant and Pickup ([*J. Phys. Chem.* 1995, **99**, 3503](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/j100011a016)).
If you use this code in your research, we would appreciate if you would include the following citation in your publication:
